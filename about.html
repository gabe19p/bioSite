          Madison Purselley is from the heart of East Texas but has now ventured
          across the world with her husband. Top destinations for her would be
          Paris, Sydney and Rome. As a military spouse, she has learned to
          adjust to a less traditional way of life. She’s always wanted to help
          people and went to school to work in the dental industry, but as
          military life moves, so does she. Her current adventure has her
          embracing the Japanese lifestyle on the tropical island of Okinawa.
          She assists special needs children with their learning journey. When
          she isn’t at work, she enjoys spending her free time cooking or
          creating content. She has recently taken up the sport of golf with her
          husband, while they document their journey together with vlogs. Her
          passion for YouTube has helped her grow as a storyteller and content
          creator. She plans to enjoy her time in Japan and then move back to
          the United States to start her family and career at a dental office.

          Madison is a strong women of faith. From a young age she was called to the missions field. She felt drawn specifically to aide in medical needs for missions work. This is her driving reason behind wanting to pursue dentistry.
